alright do these
in about add this 
"Our Official Telegram Channel @PrototypeGifts"
that is clickable and leads to this link https://t.me/PrototypeGifts
also
replace view channel link in "recent gift news" section to this as well 
and make sure
all settings do their job properly
if viberate on = phone should viberate constantly when notification is ringing REMEMBER THAT IT'S A ALARM LIKE NOTIFICATION THAT WHEN RINGS IT LASTS 8 SECOND 
Make Sure custom gift notification sound is marked and used when user selects one specifically from their device storage
make sure when play animation is disabled no animations are played at all eg, heartbeat, toggle setting animation, and remove background shadows and stuff to optimize app more
in security and privacy remove 
privacy policy, we don't need that yet
also when clicking clear data it should set app to default as it was you know cause we don't have any user data anyway
in about instead of that heart use icon 
REmove that ODD flipping/role animation when toggling any settings entirely but keep basic animations
also when disabing dark mode which of course means we're in lightmode
some buttons eg ones with light color or white color they disappear cause they match with background so fix that carefully use proper color for light mode.
